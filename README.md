Introduction
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death globally. This project analyzes patient health data to uncover patterns associated with the likelihood of heart attacks. The purpose of this analysis is to provide insights that can guide public health interventions and policies to reduce heart disease risk in the population.

Using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), we performed data cleaning, analysis, and interpretation based on specific healthcare-related questions.

Analysis Questions and Findings
1. How Many People Have Heart Disease?
We grouped patients based on their heart disease status (target).

Finding:

A significant portion of the patients were classified as having a "More chance of heart attack."

This shows that heart disease risk is highly prevalent within the dataset.

2. Number of Patients with Higher Risk by Age
We retrieved the number of patients likely to have a heart attack (More chance of heart attack) for each age.

Finding:

Certain age groups, especially between 40 to 60 years, had higher counts of patients with an increased risk.

This highlights middle-aged adults as a critical target group for intervention.

3. Most Common Type of Chest Pain Among High-Risk Patients
We examined the chest pain type (cp) among patients with a higher chance of heart attack.

Finding:

The most common chest pain type among high-risk individuals is Type 4 (asymptomatic), meaning many patients may not show obvious symptoms despite high risk.

This suggests a need for proactive screenings even when no symptoms are reported.

4. Distribution of Resting Electrocardiographic Results Among High-Risk Patients
We analyzed the resting ECG results (restecg) among high-risk patients.

Finding:

The majority of high-risk patients presented normal or slightly abnormal ECG readings.

Regular ECG monitoring can be vital in early detection of hidden heart problems.

Recommendations to the Government
Based on these findings, we recommend the following:

Targeted Health Campaigns
Focus awareness and preventive measures on middle-aged adults (ages 40â€“60) where the risk is highest.

Proactive Screenings
Encourage regular health screenings for heart disease, even for individuals without chest pain symptoms.

Cholesterol and Blood Pressure Monitoring
Provide accessible programs for monitoring cholesterol and blood pressure, as these are strongly linked to heart disease risk.

Public Education on "Silent Symptoms"
Educate the public that heart disease may not always present noticeable symptoms (e.g., asymptomatic chest pain), and preventive checkups are crucial.

Conclusion
This analysis highlights the urgent need for proactive and inclusive heart disease prevention strategies. Early identification, public education, and affordable health services could significantly reduce heart attack risks across vulnerable groups, particularly among middle-aged populations.

By acting on these insights, the government and health agencies can save lives and improve national health outcomes.
