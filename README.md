Introduction

Heart disease remains a major public health issue globally. Early detection and preventive care are critical to reducing deaths from heart attacks. This project analyzes patient health data to discover key patterns and risk factors associated with heart disease.

Using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), we carried out targeted analyses focusing on patients with a higher chance of heart attack. The goal is to inform government health authorities on areas requiring urgent interventions.

Analysis and Key Findings
1. How Many People Have Heart Disease?
We grouped patients based on their target status, which classifies their likelihood of having a heart attack.

Finding:
A significant number of patients were identified as having a higher chance of heart attack compared to those with a lower chance.

This emphasizes the need for proactive heart health monitoring in the population.

2. Number of Patients with More Chance of Heart Attack by Age
We analyzed the number of patients likely to experience a heart attack across different ages.

Finding:
Patients aged around 40–60 years had higher counts of increased heart disease risk.

This points to middle-aged adults as a key group for preventive health programs.

3. Most Common Type of Chest Pain Among High-Risk Patients
We examined the chest pain types (cp) among patients with a higher likelihood of heart attack.

Finding:
The most common chest pain type among high-risk patients is asymptomatic chest pain.

This is a concerning trend because it shows that many individuals may not display obvious warning signs despite facing a serious health threat.

4. Distribution of Resting Electrocardiographic (ECG) Results Among High-Risk Patients
We reviewed the distribution of resting ECG results (restecg) for patients at higher risk.

Finding:
Most patients showed normal or minor abnormalities in their ECG readings, even among those with a higher chance of heart attack.

This suggests that ECGs alone might not be sufficient to rule out heart risks without additional medical tests.

Recommendations to Government Health Authorities
Based on the findings above, the following measures are recommended:

1.Focus Screening on Middle-Aged Adults
Target individuals between 40–60 years for regular heart disease screenings and preventive healthcare education.

2.Promote Proactive Health Checks
Educate the public about "silent" heart disease risks and encourage health checkups even without visible symptoms.

3.Comprehensive Risk Testing
Encourage broader health evaluations beyond basic ECGs to detect hidden heart disease cases early.

4.Strengthen Public Awareness Campaigns
Launch campaigns focusing on the importance of monitoring cholesterol, blood pressure, and lifestyle risks for heart disease.

5.Make Heart Care Accessible
Provide affordable or free health screening programs for vulnerable populations, especially those in rural or underserved communities.

Conclusion
The analysis clearly shows that heart disease risks often exist without major visible symptoms. Middle-aged individuals, in particular, should be prioritized for early intervention programs.

By implementing proactive health policies based on these findings, the government can significantly reduce the incidence of heart attacks and improve national healthcare outcomes.
